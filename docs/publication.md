# Publication

**Drutai** has been published as a method review @Sun2023drutai in **_European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry_**. 

Beyond **Drutai** reported in this paper, many computational methods for drug discovery were also reviewed. Particularly, in the DeepsmirUD work @Sun2023deepsmirud, connectivity scores were used to connect drugs and diseases through regulation of [microRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA) expression.
